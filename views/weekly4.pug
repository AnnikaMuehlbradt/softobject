          | Electromangets are so cool! An electromagnet is a coil of wire with an electric current flowing through it.
          | The moving charges create a magnetic field such that the coil of wire behaves like a magnet.
          | Turning the current on or off turns the magnetic field on or off and changing the amount of furrent flowing through the coil changes the strenght of the magnetism.
          | Their uses are limitless, powering everything from

          | I am wondering if I can create an electromagnet out of textile. Maybe I can wrap or core spin copper wire around some other yarn or filament?

          | The filament is rather short. Perhaps, adding more nail polish will create more film and therefore a longer filament when pulled from the water.

          br
          i Attempt 2.  
          | I poured some of the nail polish into the water -- no longer ice water but still cold. The film is much thicker and more visible this time. Again, I attempted to extract the coagulated nail polish with the bent paper clip. No luck!

        p 
          | I think the film is too thick. I speculate that the outer layer of nail polish coagulates while the inner layer remains liquid. The outer layer is not strong enough to encase the inner layer. When I attempt to extract the nail polish, the outer layer breaks.
          br
          br
          i Attempt 3.  
          | I added a single drop of nail polish to the cold(ish) water to create a super thin film. I waited a few seconds for the nail polish to coagulate and then extracted the filament with the paper clip.

      .row.mt-4
        p The filament is still a bit short but I believe the process works. If I had a large vessel of water, I could create a really wide layer of film and long filament. I ended this particular experiment here because I started to get dizzy from the fumes of the nail polish.

          b Process 2.  
          | I wanted to try to fuse the pieces of filament together to create a longer piece of nail polish string.
          | As the nail polish has not dried (only coagulated), I should be able to stick the filament ends together. I overlapped two ends of filament and twisted them together -- hoping that the twist lends the bond some strength.
          | It worked!

      .row.mt-4
        p The total length of the nail polish string is 12.59 inches. Any length of string can be produced using this method.

      .row.mt-4
        p I took some picture of the nail polish string using a macro lens. The pictures reveal that each filament is a ribbon, a bunched-up and rolled-up piece of thin film. I am amused that the glitter is visible in the ribbon. However, where I twisted the ends of the filament to join them, the filament looks similar to nylon.

      .row.mt-4
        p I manipulated the string with my hands to get a feel for how it behaves. It is light and has a little bit of stretch (but don't stretch too much or it will snap). It is flexible and does not hold shape. I think it would be possible to spin it into a two-ply yarn and to sew with it.

          b Process 3.  
          | I wanted to learn more about what was happening to the nail polish when adding it to water, so I turned to Google. I discovered that creating thin film from clear nail polish is
          a(href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nail+polish+thin+film" target="_blank" aria-label="Google search for nail polish thin film")  a popular science experiement across the internet.  
          | A thin film of clear nail polish is a great introduction into nanotechnology providing an example of how a material behaves on the macroscale is affected by its structure on the nanoscale.
          br
          br
          | There are different types of nail polish but most "lacquer" nail polish is  
          a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_polish" target="_blank" aria-label="Wikipedia page on nail polish")  a polymer dissolved in a volatile organic solvent consisting of nitrocellulose and butyl acetate or ethyl acetate.  
          | Nail polish is 
          a(href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29743434/" target="_blank" aria-label="PDF detailing a nail polish thin film science experiment")  hydrophobic
          | , it repels water. When added to water, the nail polish spreads out into a thin film
          a(href="http://nisenet.org/sites/default/files/catalog/uploads/MaterialsFilm_guide_5oct14.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="")  a few hundred nanometers thick.  
          br
          br
          | I am unable to find a definitive answer to why the nail polish hardens in the water. Butyl acetate and ethyl acetate  
          a(href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01103a501" target="_blank" aria-label="")  do dissolve in water at around 8.5g per 100 ml of water (depending on the water temperature).  
          | Given the small amount of nail polish, I suspect that some of the acetate dissolves and the nail polish thickens.

          b Reflection.  
          | This experiment got me thinking about textile nanotechnology. Rather than nano-coating textiles (which tends to be toxic), how can we manipulate fibers to alter the properties of textiles? E.g., filament length, width, arrangement, blend, etc.
