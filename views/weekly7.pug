          b Vision.  
          | I want to make a textile out of an unconventional material; not out of fibers or filaments.
          | I am inspired by how paper is made.
          | In particular, that wood pulp can be pressed, formed, and dried into strong, flexible sheets.
          | I wonder what else can be turned into a thin sheet in this way.
          | The first thing that comes to mind are apples.
          | In fact, I remember eating fruit leather as a child.
          | Could fruit leather be a textile? Can I make it conductive somehow?

          b Process 1.  
          | I did some research on the subject matter and it turns out that there are a few companies working creating fruit leather as a textile.
          | One such company is  
          a(href="https://fruitleather.nl/" aria-label="Home page for Fruitleather Rotterdam") Fruitleather Rotterdam  
          | which makes leather out of fruit waste (fruit wasted at supermarkets).
          | The leather is treated with some natural (and secret) coating to make it waterproof.
          | Other companies have used epoxy or resin to achieve the same end.
          | Regardless of the treatment method, fruit leather seems to be strong enough to be used as a textile in clothing, hand bags, and shoes.
          | Even untreated, edible  
          a(href="https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/dry/fruit_leathers.html" aria-label="How to dry fruit leather by the National Center for Home Food Preservation.") fruit leather can last up to 1 year.

          | Making edible fruit leather is a well documented science as described
          a(href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2014/139890/" aria-label="Methods of preparation for fruit leather in the International Journal of Food Science") here.
          | Making textile fruit leather, however, has not been documented in detail.
          | In fact, I cannot find any recipes, tips, or tricks anywhere so I'll have to experiment on my own.
      .row.mt-4
        p
          b Process 2.  
          | I looked up some videos on how to make fruit leather from apples.
          | I came across two recipes that seemed to result in solid sheets. 
          a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sBv0AdQztU&feature=youtu.be" aria-label="A demonstration of how to make fruit leather from apples and black berries.") This video  
          | shows a process of peeling, chunking, and cooking the apples down (a lot). Then, straining the pulp, pouring it onto a sheet lined with parchement paper, and baking it on low temperature in the oven.
          | The publisher of the video suggests using a "cooking apple because it needs to pulp down."
          | While in 
          a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InY_pFjRzHI&feature=youtu.be" aria-label="Another demonstration of how to make fruit leather from apples.") this video,  
          | the person chunks and cooks the apples down. Then, blends the cooked apples into a puree using a blender, pours the pulp onto a sheet lined with silcone baking mat, and bakes it on low temperature in the oven.
          br
          br
          | To make the fruit leather, I used 4 lbs. of apples (2 lbs. of Granny Smith apples, a "cooking" apple, and 2 lbs. of Jazz apples).
          | I cut each apple into 8ths and removed the core bits.
          | Then, I cut the pieces into chunks.
          | When cutting the apples, I noticed that the Granny Smith apples were tougher than the Jazz apples -- crispier but also tougher somehow.
          | I left the skin on the apples (as in the second video) in the hope that the apple skin will lend strength to the fruit leather.
          | I put all of the apples chunks in a pot and cooked them down for 20 minutes.
          | I did not add water or lemon juice.
          | I did not want to dilute the mixture and I was worried that the lemon juice would break down the celulose in the apple skins therefore weakening the structure.

          | Next, I blended the mixture and added some cinnamon and nutmeg; why shouldn't my textile also taste delicious?
          | Then, I poured 1/3 of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and spread it into a thin(ish) layer using a flat cooking spoon.
          | Too thin and it might be brittle, too thick and it won't be as flexible.

          | I baked the pulp for X minutes at 170 degrees Fahrenheit (the lowest oven setting as suggested by both videos)

          | Time for some experimentation. What can I add to make the fruit leather stronger or more flexible?
          | Most commerical fruit leathers contain malto-dextrin,
          a(href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4940893/" aria-label="A review of malto-dextrin") a modified food starch derived from corn, rice, wheat, and other botanical sources.
          | This supposedly makes the leather
          a(href="http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Fruit-Leather.html" aria-label="How fruit leather is processed.")  soft and malleability.
          | In other foods, it is often used as an inexpensive additive for thickening.
          br
          br
          | I don't have malto-dextrin but I do have corn starch (Rumford Non-Gmo). The two are probably not comparable ... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
          br
          br
          | I added 2 TSPs of corn starch to 1/3 of the remaining mixture and blended it some more.
          | As corn starch requires heat to thicken, I boiled the mixture in a small saucepan for a couple of minutes.
          | Next, I poured it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and spread it out as I did before.
          | The corn starch, apple mixture is definitely more viscous than the apple mixture. 
          | Last, I popped it in the oven to dry for X minutes alongside with the previous mixture.

          b Process 3.  
          | How can I make the apple leather conductive?
          | I could mix in conductive roving, yarn, or wire but maybe there is an edible alternative?
          | A quick Google search for "conductive food" revealed that a lot of 
          a(href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/ask-an-expert/viewtopic.php?t=11269" aria-label="A forum discussing the conductivity of fruits.") fruit and vegetable juices are ion conductive. 
          | That is, fruits and vegetables contain citric and ascorbic acid which make ions.
          | To produce an electrical current, all that is needed is to add an electrode (a piece of metal) into the fruit.
          | So, as a citrus fruit, an apple makes for an excellent ionic conductor and can also be used as a  
          a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YvYWLb0KGU" aria-label="A demonstration of how to turn an apple into a battery.") (apple) battery.
          br
          br
          | So maybe my apple leather will be able to power an LED?
          | I measured the current output from a cooked piece of apple and the apple leather with a multimeter -- the multimeter as metal probes that can act as electrodes.
          | The cooked apple chunk measured 0.53 microamps and the apple leather measured X microamps.

          | Cook the apples less or more time??
