          b Vision.  
          | I want to find any materials that might be useful in constructing and integrating electronics into textiles.
          | As I intend to create a fidget knit wearable, I am specifically looking for materials that can knit with, weave into a knit, or attach to a knitted structure.
          | Other materials of interest are things that can be blended with yarns (e.g., twisted into, sprayed onto, etc.).
          br
          | I will begin scavanging for these materials by looking through the kitchen and the garage.
